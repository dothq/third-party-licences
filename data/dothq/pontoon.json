Grant of License and Limitations</h3><h4 id=\"3.1\">3.1. Scope of License</h4><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and upon Licensee&#x27;s full payment of the applicable fees, Highsoft grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software strictly within the scope of the granted License type, and to receive services and Releases included in Highcharts Advantage as described below.</p><p>The License, which shall be registered in Licensee&#x27;s name, shall commence on Delivery Date and be effective until terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p><p>When entering into this Agreement, Licensee must choose and state:</p><ol start=\"1\"><li>the Software products to be included in the license;</li><li>one or more of the License types described in section 4, and;</li><li>the number of authorized Developers to be included in the License, and;</li><li>which Web Application(s) and/or SaaS Application(s) the Licensed Software will be used in, if purchasing a SaaS License or SaaS+ License as further described in sections 4.2-4.3;</li><li>which Licensee Product(s) the Licensed Software will be used in, if purchasing an OEM License as further described in section 4.4;</li><li>the number of Customer Installations, with or without developer rights, to be included in the License, if purchasing OEM License(s) as further described in section 4.4;</li><li>Any Affiliates to be included in the License.</li></ol><p>The information listed in i)-vii) shall be stated in the License Statement.</p><p>All Optional Dependencies and Official Integrations and Add-ons are made available by Highsoft as an additional free-of-charge service, irrespective of the chosen Software product and License type, and shall not be deemed part of the Licensed Software.</p><p>Each License type grants Licensee a specific set of usage rights to Licensed Software, as described respectively in section 4.1 to 4.4 below. The offered license types described in section 4.1 (Internal License),</p><p>4.2 (SaaS License) and 4.3 (SaaS+ License) are complementary in the sense that SaaS License and SaaS+ License each includes a gradual broadened scope and more extensive usage rights than the Internal License,</p><p>e.g. the SaaS License consumes and includes more extensive rights than the Internal License. For the avoidance of doubt, an OEM License does not include any of the rights covered by an Internal License, a SaaS License or a SaaS+ License, unless such rights are added in accordance with section 4.4.3 below through a customization of the OEM License.</p><p>Depending on the purchased License type(s), sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and/or 4.4 below shall apply. The License type(s) chosen by Licensee shall be stated in Appendix A and in the License Statement.</p><p>Upon request, Highsoft may provide advice on which License type will be suitable for Licensee as this will mainly depend on Licensee’s use case. In such case, Highsoft will use its best effort to suggest a suitable License type based on the information provided by Licensee. Licensee shall bear the risk for the correctness and completeness of the information provided, and Highsoft provides no guarantees, express or implied, as</p><p>to the suitability of the chosen License type(s) and hereby disclaims any and all liability related to the choice made by Licensee.</p><h4 id=\"3.2\">3.2. General Limitations to the License</h4><h5 id=\"3.2.1\">3.2.1. Number of Developers</h5><p>Each License granted by Highsoft under this Agreement comes with a defined (limited) number of authorized Developers. Licensee acknowledges, accepts, and undertakes to ensure that the actual number of Developers at any time, whether employees or subcontractors of Licensee, shall not exceed the total number of Developers stated in License Statement. Any breach of this restriction shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement.</p><h5 id=\"3.2.2\">3.2.2. Usage by Affiliates</h5><p>The License is granted to Licensee only and does not extend to Licensee’s Affiliates at the commencement of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties by way of express identification of this extended right in the License Statement, and subject to Licensee’s payment of the additional Affiliate Fee.</p><p>Licensee may at any time and subject to an additional Affiliate Fee purchase a right for its Affiliates to use the Licensed Software within the scope of the purchased License(s) and the number of Developers and Customer Installations defined therein (if applicable). Any such subsequent extension of the License to also cover Licensee’s Affiliates must, in order to be valid, be agreed in writing between the Parties. If Licensee wishes to purchase such an Affiliate extension, Licensee shall send to Highsoft a written notice, containing (a) the number of Affiliates, and (b) the following information for each of the Affiliates that Licensee wishes to include in the purchased License(s):</p><ol start=\"1\"><li>Company name</li><li>Company registration no.</li><li>Nationality</li><li>Address</li><li>Contact information</li><li>Contact person</li></ol><p>Highsoft will thereafter update the License Statement, which will state the applicable Affiliates included in the License. An extension of the License to include Affiliates shall for the avoidance of doubt not expand the usage rights granted through this Agreement or expand the scope of the granted License unless such expansions of the License are concurrently requested and agreed between the Parties pursuant to section 17.8.</p><h5 id=\"3.2.3\">3.2.3. Access to new Releases</h5><p>Subject to restrictions and limitations applicable to the purchased License type, a purchase of a License grants Licensee the right to use the applicable Release of the Software at the time of purchase. In order to gain access to new Releases, Licensee must remain enrolled in the Highcharts Advantage plan as defined in section 5 below. Upon purchase of a License, Licensee will be automatically enrolled in the Highcharts</p><p>Advantage plan, commencing on Delivery Date, and the first twelve (12) months of Licensee’s enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan shall be included in the License Fee at no additional cost.</p><p>Licensee undertakes not to make use of any Software in other or newer versions than such Release(s) of the Licensed Software which Licensee is entitled to use pursuant to a valid enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan. Any breach of this restriction shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement.</p><p>A License granted under this Agreement is perpetual and not subject to renewal. The perpetual nature of the License is strictly limited to Release(s) of the Software to which Licensee has lawfully gained access and usage rights during a valid enrollment in the Highcharts Advantage plan. Notwithstanding its (otherwise) perpetual nature, such License shall nevertheless expire if the Agreement is lawfully terminated by Highsoft due to Licensee’s material breach, in accordance with section 13.3.</p><h5 id=\"3.2.4\">3.2.4.

Usage of Software in competing products</h5><p>Licensee undertakes not to use Software as part of any offerings comprising functionality that is substantially similar to that of Software, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) years after its termination, however occasioned. Nothing in this Agreement shall, however, be construed to preclude Licensee from using, marketing, licensing and/or selling software which is developed by Licensee on a fully independent basis, even if such software has the same or similar functionality as Software, provided always that such activities do not infringe or jeopardize Highsoft’s intellectual property rights or are in breach of other related statutory or non-statutory rules of law.</p><h4 id=\"3.3\">3.3. Identification of Licensee applications or products and optional purchase of License to future applications or products</h4><p>Licensed Software may only be incorporated into such SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products as expressly identified and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement, and the names of such applications or products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee upon entering into this Agreement, in accordance with section 3.1. The Parties may agree in writing that the names of the SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee to Highsoft after the Delivery Date, i.e. if the applications or products are still unnamed at the time of entering into this Agreement. In such case, the number of SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be listed in Appendix A and the License Statement, and the names of the SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products (as applicable) shall be provided by Licensee to Highsoft after the Delivery Date, upon which the License Statement will be updated. Licensee is not authorized to use Licensed Software in any</p><p>SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products not identified in the License Statement, i.e. after notice has been provided to Highsoft in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p>Licensee may also choose to purchase a SaaS License, SaaS+ License or OEM License for use in future SaaS Applications, Web Applications or Licensee Products. In such case, Licensee must, upon purchase of the License, provide to Highsoft the number of SaaS Applications, Web Applications and/or Licensee Products (as applicable) to be included in the License, which will be listed as unnamed products in the License Statement.</p><p>When Licensee wishes to utilize the purchased License for the optional future applications or products, Licensee shall give notice to Highsoft of this and state the names of the applications and/or products as well as any changes (if applicable) in the scope of the purchased License required by Licensee before incorporation of the Licensed Software into the applications or products, upon which the License Statement shall be updated accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement that Licensed Software may only be incorporated into such SaaS Applications, Web applications or Licensee Products as expressly identified and approved by Highsoft in the License Statement, shall also apply for such optional future applications or products, and the Licensee is not authorized to incorporate the Licensed Software into such applications or products before Licensee has notified Highsoft in accordance with this paragraph and the License Statement has been adjusted accordingly.</p><p>While the non-reusable nature of SaaS, SaaS+ and OEM Licenses does not authorize Licensee to change or replace a SaaS Application, Web Application or Licensee Product with another application or product under the same License, this shall not be deemed to preclude Licensee from changing the name of a SaaS Application, Web Application or Licensee product included in a License, and to request that the License Statement is adjusted accordingly.</p><h4 id=\"3.4\">3.4. Special terms for Highcharts Dashboards</h4><p>The following terms and conditions shall be applicable insofar as the Licensed Software includes Highcharts Dashboards, in addition to the terms otherwise set out herein this Agreement.</p><p>In addition to using the standard components included in the library provided by Highsoft to a Licensee holding a License to Highcharts Dashboards, Highcharts Dashboards enables Developers to make custom components or add Third Party components to dashboards created using Highcharts Dashboards.

The usage of this functionality shall for the avoidance of doubt not lead to such persons being regarded as Developers or count</p><p>towards the total count of Licensee’s included Developers, insofar as such persons will not be working with or accessing the API and/or source code of the Licensed Software. The restrictions related to generation of static content in section 4.1 below shall furthermore not be construed as prohibiting Licensee from enabling users to access the “Editor Mode” to modify, add, remove, move, or resize components in dashboards created by Licensee holding an Internal License, in so far as the parameters of interaction and modification of such components remain the same for all such users, and such actions do not require working with or accessing the API and/or source code of the Licensed Software.</p><h3 id=\"4\">4.

Internal License</h4><p>Through an Internal License, Highsoft grants Licensee a non-exclusive, perpetual (for applicable Releases), non-sublicensable, worldwide right to install, reproduce, use and further develop Licensed Software as such:</p><ol start=\"1\"><li>on any number of public or private websites (including subdomains and intranet sites) for generation of static content, and;</li><li>on any Internal Applications</li></ol><p>An Internal License authorizes Licensee to use the Licensed Software for internal purposes only and extends to Licensee’s employees and contractors, but not to its clients or other Third Parties.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
