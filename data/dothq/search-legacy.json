You may not attempt to alter or\nrestrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\na. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\nas described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\nExecutable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\nreasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\nof distribution to the recipient; and\n\nb.

If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\nwith a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\nSoftware is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\nYou to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\nsuch Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\ntheir option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\neither this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4.

Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\nof any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\nwarranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\nalone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\nwith respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\norder, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\nthey affect.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\nand cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\nall Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\nshall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\nlicense agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\nvalidly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\ntermination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\nwithout limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\nmerchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\nrisk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\nShould any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\nContributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\ncorrection. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\nLicense. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\nexcept under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\ndistributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\ndirect, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\ncharacter including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\ngoodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\ninformed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\nparty’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\na jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\nand such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\nreference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\nprevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\nhereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\ncontract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\nthis License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2.

Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the\nterms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n2.0.
