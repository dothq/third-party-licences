Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n>\n> 4. Redistribution.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n>\n> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n>\n> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n### unherit@v1.1.3\n\nLicense: MIT\nBy: Titus Wormer\n\n> (The MIT License)\n>\n> Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\na. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\nas described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\nExecutable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\nreasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\nof distribution to the recipient; and\n\nb.

Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.

Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\nreinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\nreceived notice of non-compliance with this License from such\nContributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\nof the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\nlicense agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\nvalidly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\ntermination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\nwithout warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\nincluding, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\nof defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\nThe entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\nis with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\nYou (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\nrepair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\npart of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\nthis License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\ndistributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\ndirect, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\ncharacter including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\ngoodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\ninformed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\nsuch party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\nlimitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\nnot apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\nof a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\nbusiness and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\nin this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\ncounter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\nthe language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\nbe used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3.

Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\nIncompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\nthe License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\nattached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the\nterms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n2.0.
